## Introduction

Lockwright is an open-source, privacy-first password and identity manager. It encrypts and stores all data locally on your device.

Unlike traditional password managers that rely on centralized servers, Lockwright is built on [Pear Runtime](https://pears.com/) and uses peer-to-peer technology to sync your credentials directly between your devices. No cloud account. The credentials stay under your control.

The on-disk vault at the fork point is PearPass's. Vault work in this tree aims to open those vaults in place. Test that on a copy.

---

## Features

- **Encrypted-at-rest storage.** Lockwright encrypts passwords, credit cards, secure notes, and custom fields before writing them to disk.
- **Biometric authentication.** Unlock your vault with fingerprint or face recognition.
- **Cross-device sync.** Credentials sync directly between your devices, with no central server.
- **Offline access.** Access your vault anytime, even without a network connection.
- **Password health.** Analyse password strength and identify weak passwords.
- **Random password generator.** Generate strong, unique passwords.
- **Easy-to-use interface.** A clean, intuitive design for managing credentials on the go.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js.** Check the required version in `.nvmrc` and verify with:

```bash
node --version
```

- **pnpm** `11.10.0` (`packageManager` in `package.json`)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Thaoh/lockwright-app-mobile.git

# 2. Go to the cloned directory
cd lockwright-app-mobile

# 3. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 4. Generate translation keys
pnpm run lingui:extract
pnpm run lingui:compile

# 5. Generate worklet bundles
pnpm run bundle-bare

# 6. Generate native iOS and Android directories (see Prebuild below)
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

In the Lockwright superproject, run `./scripts/fetch-packages.sh --layout` so `file:../pearpass-lib-vault` resolves.

---

## Usage Examples

[lockwright.dexterity.works](https://lockwright.dexterity.works) is the Lockwright site.

PearPass docs at [docs.pass.pears.com](https://docs.pass.pears.com) still describe setup, vault management, syncing, and the rest of the product at the fork point. They are not Lockwright docs.

---

## Architecture

This project uses **Expo Plugins** to manage native iOS and Android configurations. Git does not track the `ios/` and `android/` directories. Expo's prebuild system generates them dynamically.

### Key Points:

- Git ignores the native directories (`ios/` and `android/`).
- Expo plugins in the `plugins/` directory manage all native configurations.
- Running `npx expo prebuild --clean` generates the native directories with all necessary configurations.

---

## Starting the Application

Before starting the application, build it first. The build command produces bundles for iOS, iOS extension, and Android, and runs the custom prebuild:

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm run build

# Then start on your preferred platform
pnpm run ios      # For iOS
pnpm run android  # For Android
```

---

## Prebuild

This repo is Expo-managed. Prebuild generates the native `android/` and `ios/` folders; they are not committed.

### Standard (Play/normal) Android prebuild

```bash
pnpm run bundle-bare
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
```

### F-Droid Android prebuild

```bash
pnpm run bundle-bare
PEARPASS_DISTRIBUTION=fdroid npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean
```

- [`docs/fdroid/version-check.md`](docs/fdroid/version-check.md)

---

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Run unit tests with Jest:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### End-to-End Testing

Lockwright uses WebdriverIO + Appium for end-to-end testing on Android and iOS, with optional BrowserStack execution and Qase test management.

See [`e2e/SETUP_AND_RUN_GUIDE.md`](e2e/SETUP_AND_RUN_GUIDE.md) for the full setup and run instructions, and [`e2e/AUTOMATED_TEST_CASES.md`](e2e/AUTOMATED_TEST_CASES.md) for the test catalog.

## Logging

Logging is off by default. When enabled, logs are written to the app's cache directory: `main.log` from the JS host (React Native side) and `core-logs.txt` from the Bare vault worker. The worker's sink redacts known sensitive fields (passwords, keys, tokens, etc.) before writing to `core-logs.txt`. The host logger does not redact, so treat anything passed to `logger.*` on the JS side as on-disk-visible in `main.log`.

Two ways to enable:

- **In-app toggle** (Settings → Diagnostics → **Enable logs**). Persists across launches. Toggling off stops writes but keeps existing log files; toggling back on resumes appending to the same files, so a session can span multiple toggles.
- **Nightly builds** (`PearPass-nightly`): logging defaults to `debug` on first launch so testers don't have to opt in. The toggle still works to disable it.

Logs can be shared via the Diagnostics screen **Share logs** action, which zips both files plus a small metadata file (app version, distribution channel).

---

## Error reporting

**Lockwright mobile is open source. Public releases and self-built versions never send any data anywhere. Sentry is only enabled on the nightly distribution channel for catching crashes during pre-release testing.**

Verifying:

- The gate is `isNightly()` from `src/constants/distribution.js`. Returns `false` unless the distribution channel is `nightly`.
- The Expo config plugin for Sentry is only loaded when `PEARPASS_DISTRIBUTION=nightly` at build time. `app.config.ts`. `app.json` has no Sentry plugin entry, so standard / F-Droid builds never include it.
- The Bare-side Sentry SDK (`sentry-bare`) is an optional peer dependency of `pearpass-lib-vault-core`. Public builds don't install it.
